    <p>
      Biopython used to have static copies of various example files used in the
      <a href="http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html">Biopython Tutorial</a>
      (<a href="https://github.com/biopython/biopython/tree/master/Doc/examples">PDF</a>)
      online under this folder. These were manually kept in sync with the main
      Biopython source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the website is now part of the Biopython <tt>DIST</tt> GitHub
      Repository at <a href="https://github.com/biopython/DIST">github.com/biopython/DIST</a>
      using GitHub Pages.

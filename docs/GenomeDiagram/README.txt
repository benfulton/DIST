This folder contains a copy of the stand-alone GenomeDiagram
manual originally available at the following (defunct) webpage,
http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/lp/downloads/programs/genomediagram/userguide.pdf

The source LaTeX file dates from 2006, but it was recompiled into
a PDF on 12 December 2011 (the date shown in the PDF file).

GenomeDiagram was integrated into Biopython as of release 1.50
(20 April 2009) with most of the functionally now available in the
module Bio.Graphics.GenomeDiagram and described in the Biopython
Tutorial (including advice on porting any old code using the
standalone library).

This old manual is still of interest for some of the graphics
options not yet covered in the Biopython Tutorial.
